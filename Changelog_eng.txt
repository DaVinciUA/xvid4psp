
XviD4PSP 5.0.37.4(Unofficial)->5.0.37.5(Unofficial) 09.08.09 pre-Changelog:

sorry for my bad english :D    

>>> Added posibility to save encoding log to file. It will be created in Temp-folder or in current working folder - depen-
    nding on settings. Also if you make double-click on text in encoding window, current contents of this window also
    will be saved as log-file (on this time file will be created in the current working folder, no matter what you choose
    in settings). And if an error has occur while encoding, log-file will be saved automaticaly (in Temp-folder, as
    error.log).

>>> Added batch encoding function (File->Open folder...). First you must select folder in which you stored the source
    files, then you must select destination folder, in which encoded files will be placed (it can be the same folder).
    To avoid opening all the files in the folder, filter was introduced, that select only files wich specified file-
    extension. You can edit valid extensions in Settings->Global settings->Batch encoding menu, also here you can choose,
    do you want to programm start encoding your files immediately after opening thy all, or no. In case if destination
    file name is exist in selected folder, file name will be changed - full file name (with extension) of the source file
    will be added at the begining of the destination file name. After opening all the files in the folder, you will see
    statistics window, and for the latest opened file will be loaded preview. If you want to open one more folder, you 
    can do it now. Known issues:
    --in the process of opening one of the file may occur an error, and programm may hang up or something else..
    --in the process of opening one of the file, a programm window may appear (for selecting audio track, or something).
    --after opening audio-file programm change encoding format to Audio, and all other files will be opened with this
      format. To avoid this you must: delete (or replace) all audio-files from you folder, or (better way) edit valid
      file-extensions in the Settings->Global settings->Batch encoding menu.
    --you can`t pre-specified some parameters for the encoding file, such as resolution, etc. You can only: select filt-
      ration, colorcorrection, video and audio codec settings, and encoding format (but you need to open one file first,
      to some of this settings became available). Also you can use auto-options, that working after opening file (auto-
      volume, auto-crop, auto-deinterlace).
    --may be the new Custom format will help with previous issue, if you will be able to configure it as you need :)

>>> Instead of old plugin nnedi.dll now will be used new nnedi2.dll (it`s used in YadifModEDI, MCBob and NNEDI deinterlace
    filters).

>>> Added test of the Temp folder, to check is there are some files in it, or it`s empty. This check will be run after
    you selecting a new Temp-folder in Settings, or when programm find another disc with more free-space, and you hit Yes.
    If Temp-folder is not empty, an error window will appear, that will propose to go into the folder to delete files, or
    ignore this message. But it`s strongly recommended that you delete all not needed files, especialy if they starts
    with 4 digits (like 0358.h264 or 1254.mp3). Also in Settings->Global settings->Temp files was added Open button
    (to open selected Temp-folder).

>>> Now form the filtering preset to current script will be replaced and empty lines (that contains nothing; they are dele-
    ting before) - it must enhances readability of the script.
  
>>> Added --subme10 for the x264.

>>> Added very experimental Custom format. All settings from this format is stored in the FormatSettings.ini file, and 
    you can change it manualy, or use for this purpose specially designed new window - Edit format. Maybe in the future
    some other formats also will be transferred from the programm to this ini-file.

>>> Little fix for the new MediaInfo: if it says that video have PullDown, and if it have 23.976fps, then in programm retu-
    rnes value 29.970 fps. This fix was needed because MPEG2Source, using PullDown flag, will play this video at the
    29.970 fps. In other way, w/o this fix XviD5PSP will thinking that video is realy have 23fps, and did`t start process
    of deinterlace-analysing. But after this fix Xvid4PSP will start this process, and then turn on TIVTC for this video.

>>> In Video->Decoding->MPEG files menu was added new item: ForceFilm for MPEG2Source (for DGIndex). If you enable this
    option, DGIndex will indexing all mpeg files with option ForcedFilm (read DGIndex manual first!). Don`t forget to
    turn it OFF after using! Newer try to use it if you don`t understand what it does!

>>> In the Tools menu item WPF Video Player was replaced by Open XviD4PSP folder. It will open folder, where XviD4PSP is
    located (may help, if you want to edit or change some files by yourself).

>>> Now in the encoding log you will see all info, that x264 produce when encoding. All lines from this log have filtering
    before, and in some cases this results in loosing some log-info (some error messages didn`t showing).  

>>> Fixed number of audio-channels detection using ffmpeg.exe. This was broken due to some changes in ffmpeg info-log.

>>> In "forbidden to copy" was added files with extensions: .avs, .d2v(only for video stream) and .dga(only for video st-
    ream).

>>> Some other changes..

XviD4PSP 5.0.37.3(Unofficial)->5.0.37.4(Unofficial) Changelog:


>>> Added function Trim. It will work only for encoding, not for Copy mode.

>>> Now when you save current task, some parametres of the video will be recalculated (readed from the Avisynth-script).
    This was done because when script was changed manualy, these parameters also may have changes.
    --You can enable this feature in the global settings (disable by default).

>>> Fixed error when closing file, if player engine is MediaBridge.

>>> In the Resolution\Aspect and Deinterlace windows added button Fullscreen. Also now you can open Resolution\
    Aspect window if you press R on keyboard, for the Deinterlace window you must press I button.

>>> Aspect\Resolution window was splitted on two parts: Main and Settings. Added aspect error indicator and option 
    "Recalculate aspect when crop is using".

>>> Added posibility to use a new FFmpegSource2 instead of old FFmpegSource, whose development has been stopped. You
    can specify which one will be used in Video->Decoding->FFmpegSource menu. By default will be used old version.

>>> Added one more decoder (source) for the video: DirectShowSource2 (DSS2) from Haali. DSS2 can provide frame accurate
    seeking, standart DirectShowSource can`t provide this. Also this decoder not using your sytem-codecs for decoding
    Audio (will be used internal plugins, that cames with XviD4PSP). You can choose this decoder in menu Video->Decoding..
    --thanks to Procrustean for the info about DSS2.
  
>>> Yamb, MKVextractGUI and AVI-Mux was added it the Tools menu.
   
>>> Fixed auto adding (not adding) audio files from the folder where *.dga project is located, if file names have 
    track_N string, (tsRemuxer add this info when demuxing file).
    --reported by Procrustean.

>>> x264 settings window have been reworked. Few new options was added, some elements was relocated. Also many changes
    for the new x264 (r1177+) was made. Rewritten tooltips, changed fast codec-presets (Main->Presets) and presets, that
    storing in .txt-files (but only for this formats: AVI, MP4, MKV, M2TS, MP4 PS3 or XBOX360, MP4 PSP AVC, TS) 
    --All presets, tooltips, testing and some code changes - by Procrustean. Testing, some good ideas and comments - 
      by Makkay.

>>> Spline64Resize was added as one more resizer in Resolution\Aspect window. Some new histograms added in the Color-
    correction window.
    --it`s only have sense if you using AviSynth 2.5.8 

>>> Some other changes..

Seems that 5.036 was last official version of the XviD4PSP. Winnydows (developer of the XviD4PSP) says many times that project 
XviD4PSP was stopped, and instead of this program he making new one - Winnydows Commander (with also contains Multi-encoder 
feature). This version of XviD4PSP I made only for myself. It means that all changes that I made were necessary for me, for me
and only for me. But if this changes will also necessary for you - I will be very glad :)
I`m not a programmer, so please forgive me all new bugs! :D You will use this version at your own risk!!!
